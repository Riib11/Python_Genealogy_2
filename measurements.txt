Speed of taveover of dominant trait: D and S values.
    How to measure this speed:
    - How fast to get to 50% (A'|50%) from a percentage (lets say there will be one trait A)
    - Look at max of first derivative

- Speed versus Fitess
- Chance of getting chosen as a parent
- Add option for theri to be x genes with each having y different values
    - When calculating fitness from traits:
        - Additive
        - Multiplicative (nonlinear)

Goals:
- Make graphs using new measurements for trait values vs time
- For matrix diagram, make the centering be more interesting
